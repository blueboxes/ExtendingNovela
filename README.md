## About Gatsby Novela

Gatsby Novela is a blog Theme created by the team at [Narative](https://www.narative.co), and built for everyone that loves the web. For more on this see https://www.narative.co/labs/novela/


## About this Code

This code is based on the Novela default starter. Modifications have then been added via Gatsby [theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/).

These modifications include:

* Cookie Banner
* Home Page Layout
* Padding and Margins
* Table of Contents
* RSS Icon
* Social Share Links

This code is shared to demo these as part of [blog post](https://blueboxes.co.uk/extending-the-gatsby-novela-blog-theme) and is not guaranteed to work in the future and will not be updated.
